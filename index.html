    <h4>"She's a supportive and kind gorl that is funny in her own special way" ~ Jules</h4>
    <h4>"You are amazing in your own unique way and your the type of person everyone wants to hang with" ~ Uncle Cassy</h4>
    <h4>"I mean like I havenâ€™t known her for that long and I havenâ€™t even seen her in person (is she just a robot?!)<br>
         but right off the bat when I was introduced to her she was so sweet and funny plus we share a common interest over kdramas lmao<br>
         which is always a topic I can scream at her about. And donâ€™t get me started on her memes istg- <br>
         but like yeah what I said before she is a super sweet girl ðŸ’œ" ~ Kat</h4>
