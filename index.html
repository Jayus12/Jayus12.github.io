         but right off the bat when I was introduced to her she was so sweet and funny plus we share a common interest over kdramas lmao<br>
         which is always a topic I can scream at her about. And donâ€™t get me started on her memes istg- <br>
         but like yeah what I said before she is a super sweet girl ðŸ’œ" ~ Kat</h4>
